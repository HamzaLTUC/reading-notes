To write a script firstly we need to specify our goal and then list the tasks we need to complete in order. we can follow these steps to make it easier:
1. Define the goal! 
2. Design the script
3. code each step

Every step for every task shown in a flowchart needs to be written in a language that the computer understands and follows. We need to learn to think like a computer because they solve tasks differently than we think!

• Functions : 
let us group a series of the statement to perform a specific task it helps us to organize the code. its work like store hold statement that is contained in the curly bracket until we are ready to use them 
The statements aren’t run until the function is called 
To run the code in the function we can use function name followed by parentheses or sometimes function needs specific information to perform its task
