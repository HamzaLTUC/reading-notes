***A growth mindset***: it a belief in your abilities to do something and be persistent in it, develop yourself regularly to face the obstacles it’s a passion of working hard and achievement 

There are two types of minds growth mind and fixed mind and people are divided between them.
Growth mind people set embrace challenges and keep persistent to solve it while fixed is still thinking about it and avoid it, growth mindset is keeping learning from its faults while fixed ignoring.

*for myself*, I like **challenging**, I consider myself an **ambitious** , **patience person**  I put the goal in my sight and keep moving forward. as the quotes say: dream big, stay positive work hard and enjoy the journey!
