# How Computers Work

Early Computers was a sizer of room and take hours to assemble and barely solving the basic math problem.
Computer is everywhere in our home in cars.
inputs, storage, processing, output these are 4 common things that make computer s computer 

input: what you do to make the computer take a reaction like writing my keyboard using mouse etc.

storage:  different input  give computer information which stored in memory, computer processor takes information from memory  its changes using series of command and then it sends this processed information back to memory sand still processing  till the information is ready to be output,

output: its different depends on what the computer designed to do 
every input or output of a computer is a type of information 
the computer works in One and Zeroes which play a big role in how computers work on the inside.
In the binary number system, we only have two digits 0 & 1, and decimal from 0-9 
We can represent any number we like and we can represent text, images, videos, sound  in a Binary system

circuits: is the process which computer does to make information is output which is modified and combine the input signals using millions if teeny electronic computer which comes tighter and performs circuits and its controls by CPU

bunch of circuits, chips, wires, speakers, plug and all sorts of other things is hardware, while software all the computer programs or codes running on the machine.
the operating system is the master program that manages usingof the software.
