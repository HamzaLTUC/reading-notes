# Chapter 11 colors :

we can express colors in CSS in three different ways:
1. RGB ( Red , Green , Blue ) , example : rgb(101,150,85)

2. HEX Codes: six digits preceded by a pound sign, example: #ee3a70.

3. Color names: red, yellow, etc...

CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears in a box and the
background-color property sets the color of the background
for that box  If we do not specify a background color, then the
the background is transparent.

colors are made of a mix between Red, Green, Blue, we can use the color picker to choose.
we can use opacity which allows you to specify the opacity of an element The value is a number between 0.0 and 1.0 (so a value of 0.5 is 50% opacity and 0.15 is 15%
opacity).

CSS introduces us three-way to specify colors:
1. HUE: color circle. Circle
2. Saturation: the amount of grey color. 
gray in a color.
3. Lightness: Lightness is the amount of white color.
