# Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formaÂ¬ing words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

And there are some of important markdown codes:
 Code | usage
 -----|------
  ``#``  | heading like h1 
  `*` text `*` or `_text_` | make text italic 
 `**`text`** ` | make text bold
 `*` | make unorder list
`![Alt Text](url)` | add picture
`[site  title`](url)| add url
  `>` | Blockquotes
` |  type Inline code
