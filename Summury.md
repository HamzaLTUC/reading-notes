**I will share what Iâ€™ve learned when I've done 
these assignments** 


**we *introduced* to Git its nucleus of GitHub 
which is an open-source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.**

*Then* we learned how to create a repo and add files on it using the GitHub website.
and we tried to edit a repo file using  markdown tools its concerned about styling in simple symbols

*also*, we used the clone feature which allows us to get a version of a file and edit it locally using VS Code, and on the opposite, we learned how to push a file on GitHub using git add. then git commit -m then git push the main origin .and to type your user name on GitHub and password and it will reflect on your file on Github.
