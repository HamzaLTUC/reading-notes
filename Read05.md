# Loops 
Loops check a condition. if it true a code block will run and then check the condition will be checked again and if still true the code block will run again. it still working until the conditions return false.

there are three common types of loops:
1. For: if we need to run a code a specific number of times
2. While if we do not know how many times the code should run.
3. While do is similar to while loop but it always run the statement inside the curly braces al least once even if the condition evaluates to false
