Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; forma¬ing words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

and there are some of important markdown codes:
Heading like h1 | #
italic          | *text* or _text_
Unordered data  | * text
